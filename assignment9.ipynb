    "Use the class template below and inherit from your [Assignment 7](https://github.com/PGE392K/assignment7) `OneDimReservoir()` class, complete the implementation of `compute_transmissibility()` and `compute_accumulation()` such that they will compute interblock transmissiblities for grid blocks that could potentially differ in permeability, grid spacing in both the $x$ and $y$-directions and depth, as well as accumulation terms that can vary from grid block to grid block in terms of volumes and porosities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then complete the implementation of `fill_matrices()` to account for the additional boundary conditions on the top and bottom. You may look back to [Assignment 2](https://github.com/PGE392K/assignment2) for help with the structure of the now, pentadiagonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now a few additional inputs such as number of grid block in the $x$ and $y$ directions. See the [test.py](test.py) file for the additional input syntax.  Your code should still pass all the old 1D test cases as a 1D reservoir is just a special case of a 2D reservoir (i.e. with only 1 grid block the $y$ direction)."
